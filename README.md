The VFD Collective shared projects

Glad to see you. While having a colorful time, here are a few places to roam freely (sorted by relevance)
  - FluorescenceV3: (V3) Source code of firmware version 3.0 for OpenVFD & Fluorescence. Includes source code for Arduino, STM32 HAL and simulation with Qt GUI
  - FluorescenceApp: (V3) Source code of the app for OpenVFD & Fluorescence
  - openvfd_firmware: (V2 Legacy) Those sparking code lines for OpenVFD & Fluorescence. The cool thing about the firmware is that it is only one single file. Throw it into your Arduino IDE, compile and have fun. Oh and don't forget to tear it apart and get creative yourself
  - myOpenVFD-vs: (V2 Legacy) Source code of myOpenVFD Windows application
  - hardware/eagle: (V2 Legacy) Public Fluorescence/OpenVFD Eagle files to USE OR REFERENCE AT YOUR VERY OWN RISK as some of the layouts have never been produced or tested. Spot EcoPower in there.
  
Cheers.</br>
