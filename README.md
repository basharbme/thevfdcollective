Glad to see you, welcome to the repository of Fluorescence by The VFD Collective. While having a colorful time, here are a few places to roam freely:
  - FluorescenceV3: (active) Source code of firmware version 3.0 for OpenVFD & Fluorescence. Includes source code for Arduino, STM32 HAL and simulation with Qt GUI
  - FluorescenceApp: (active) Source code of the app for OpenVFD & Fluorescence. The cross platform app enables communicating to Fluorescence over USB and Bluetooth
  - FluorescenceCompiled: (active) Official compiled versions of FluorescenceApp and firmware files for Fluorescence
  - hardware: (active) Public Fluorescence/OpenVFD Eagle files. Includes libraries and published PCB designs

No longer updated, kept for reference only:
  - openvfd_firmware: (V2 Legacy) Those sparking code lines for OpenVFD & Fluorescence. The cool thing about the firmware is that it is only one single file. Throw it into your Arduino IDE, compile and have fun. Oh and don't forget to tear it apart and get creative yourself
  - myOpenVFD-vs: (V2 Legacy) Source code of myOpenVFD Windows application

  
Cheers.</br>
